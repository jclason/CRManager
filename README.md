CRManager
=========

A mobile conference room manager that will run on cheap tablets on each room's door to display it's meeting schedule. It will allow users to add a new meeting and change it's start and end times from inside the app. This will eventually be expanded to work with the Exchange's conference room reservations using the EWS api.
